# Ap_Genome_Assembly

This repository contains the latest scripts and assembly files for the genome *Alliaria petiolata*. If you are interested in collaborating on, or contributing to, genomic resources for this species, please contact Dr. Colautti (see https://EcoEvoGeno.org).

See genome aseembly details in Alabi et al. "A draft genome of *Alliaria petiolata* (garlic mustard) as a model system for invasion genetics" available on [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.17.431678v1) and a genome report in G3 (In Review).

For more information on seed collections, field data, and other resources for this sytem, see our [Neobiotata paper](https://neobiota.pensoft.net/article/1270/)

# Data Availability

To run these scripts, you will need to download the raw data from DDBJ/ENA/GenBank:

 * __PRJNA702530__ - Bioproject for all samples and data for the genome assembly and annotation.
 
 * __SAMN17958863__ - Biosample EFCC-3-20, the genotype used for WGS assembly.
 * __AHZTW000000000__ - Whole Genome Shotgun project, including final assembly (fasta) and annotation (gff)
 * __SRR13765007__ through SRR13765010 - Raw sequence reads for WGS

 * __SAMN17984654__ through SAMN17984657 - Biosamples used for the transcriptome assembly.
 * __SRR13765003__ through SRR13765006 - Raw sequence reads from the ribo-depleted RNA library.

The latest genome assembly scripts are currently maintained on GitHub (https://github.com/ColauttiLab/Ap_Genome_Assembly).
